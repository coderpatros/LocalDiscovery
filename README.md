Sunshine Coast Local Discovery

A simple app to help find new facilities to use around the Sunshine Coast.

Instead of just displaying facilities on a map it allows you to only display 
facilities that are within close proximity to other facilities. For example only
display playgrounds that also have a BBQ.

This was an entry in Sunshine Coast Council's HackFest 2016.
